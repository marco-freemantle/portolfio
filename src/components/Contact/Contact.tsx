              After completing my studies, I pursued practical experience and
              worked as a software engineer at Media Advancements. In this role,
              I actively contributed to their extensive codebase. My tasks
              encompassed TypeScript programming, collaborating with back-end
              APIs, debugging and writing tests. I was able to apply my
              knowledge of computer science to real-world problems and develop
              my skills as a software engineer.

              During my time as a computer science student at The Open
              University, I excelled academically and graduated with a
              first-class honors degree. I cultivated a robust understanding of
              object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and web
              technologies. I also developed a strong foundation in mathematics,
              computer science theory and problem solving.
